## Content Guidelines

### Question Quantity
- Unless specified elsewhere, create a quiz with 10 questions.

### Question Quality
- Create questions that test **comprehension, analysis, and application** - not just memorization
- Include questions at different difficulty levels (basic recall, interpretation, critical thinking)
- Focus on the most important concepts, themes, and details from the documents
- Avoid overly specific details unless they're crucial to understanding
- Avoid questions about specific equations, but it is fine to ask about concepts in the equations.  For example instead of asking about equations for a circle, you could ask how the area changes as the radius changes.

### Question Distribution
Generate approximately:
- 70% multiple choice questions
- 20% multiple answer questions  
- 10% true/false questions

### Answer Choices for Multiple Choice
- Make all distractors (wrong answers) plausible but clearly incorrect
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above" unless necessary
- Keep answer lengths similar
- Don't make the correct answer obviously longer or more detailed

### Question Types
- Do not use essay or short answer types, even though the format allows for this

### Feedback (Optional)
You can add feedback using:
```
1. Question text here?
... General feedback for all students.
+ Feedback for correct answers.
- Feedback for incorrect answers.
*a) Correct choice
... Specific feedback for this choice.
b) Incorrect choice
... Specific feedback for this choice.
```

## Technical Requirements

- **Each question must have exactly one correct answer** (for multiple choice)
- **No blank lines within a question** - use proper spacing between questions only
- **Maintain consistent formatting** - asterisks, brackets, and numbering must be exact
- **Keep questions clear and concise** but comprehensive enough to test understanding
- **Number questions sequentially** starting from 1
